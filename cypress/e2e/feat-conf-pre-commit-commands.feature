Feature: Precommit Commands - Update version in package.json

  Background: 
    Given I create a "public" repository named "semver-PR-{PR_NUMBER}-{TEST_KEY}"
    And I update the file "README.md" in the branch "main" with the content:
      """
      # Example GH action
      
      ```yml

    And I push the file "update-version-in-readme.sh" to the branch "main" with the content:

  Scenario: Merge a PR with a commit fixing something
    Given I create a branch named "feat-pre-commit-commands"
    And I commit "fix: commit that fixes something in the lambda1" modifying the file "src/lambda1/lambda1.py"
    And I create a PR with title "test pre commit commands"
    When I merge it
    Then the workflow "cangulo-actions/semver test" must conclude in "success"
    And the last commit message must be:
      """
      [skip ci] created release 0.0.1 - fix: commit that fixes something in the lambda1 (#1)
      
      ## patches:
      * fix: commit that fixes something in the lambda1 (#1)
      """
    And the last commit must be tagged with "0.0.1"
    And the file "README.md" must contain "example-gh-action@0.0.1"
