- Changes must be merged into one squash commit
- The release title will be taken from the last commit message
- No more than one commit is expected
- PRs commit must follow conventional commits. Please check the section Conventional Commits

## Conventional Commits and semver

Semantic Version is a proposal for versioning apps based on 3 types of releases: major, minor and patch. Each one is a number integrated in the whole app version:

> `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- `MAJOR` => A major released includes changes that make the app incompatible. The first number (`MAJOR`) is increased and the previous one reset to 0.
- `MINOR` => A minor release includes new features that consumer can integrate directly or with new inputs they can provide. It increases the second number `MINOR` and reset the last one.
- `PATCH` => A patch release (or simply a patch) includes bug fixes.

This GH action aims to make the version increase depend on the commits merged. For that, commits must follow the next convention pattern:

> `<type>: <description>`

- `<type>` classifies the changes the commit includes. Each possible value is linked to a release type. For example: `fix` means this commit includes a bug fix setting the next release to be a patch. Please check the next table for the accepted types and the release linked.
- `<description>` explains how this commit affects the solution.
- Please note `: ` semicolon followed by one space between the type and the description.

| `type`     | `release` |
| ---------- | --------- |
| `break`    | major     |
| `feat`     | minor     |
| `fix`      | patch     |
| `refactor` | none      |
| `chore`    | none      |
| `test`     | none      |
| `docs`     | none      |
| `ci`       | none      |

You can check the default config [here](config.default.yml)

- Please note if more than one commit is merged. The one with the higher release type will be taken into account. Example: You merge a `fix: ...` and a `break: ...` the next version will be a major.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Commits merged with a different type than the previous one won't trigger a release
- üìë You can customize the accepted commit types and the release linked. Please check the section [Custom Commit Types](#custom-commit-types).
- üî≠ This GH action also support scopes in the commit message. The pattern would be: `<type>(scope1,scope2,...,scopeN): <description>`. Details in the [Monorepos or multilayer solutions](#monorepos-or-multilayer-solutions) section.

## Examples

### Simplest case

Here is an example that will tag and create GH releases when a PR is merged

```yml
name: üöÄ continuous-delivery

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  semver:
    name: üöÄ release new version
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4.1.1
    - name: release new version
      uses: cangulo-actions/semver@main
      id: semver
      with:
        create-gh-release: true
        print-summary: true
    - name: print semver output
      if: ${{ steps.semver.outputs.new-version-released }}
      env:
        CHANGES: ${{ steps.semver.outputs.changes }}
        CHANGELOG_RECORD: ${{ steps.semver.outputs.changelog-record }}
        SCOPES: ${{ steps.semver.outputs.scopes }}
      run: |
        echo "version:        ${{ steps.semver.outputs.version }}"
        echo "release-title:  ${{ steps.semver.outputs.release-title }}"
        echo "release-type:   ${{ steps.semver.outputs.release-type }}"
        echo "release-url:    ${{ steps.semver.outputs.release-url }}"
        echo "commit-id:      ${{ steps.semver.outputs.commit-id }}"

        echo "changes:"
        echo "$CHANGES" | jq .

        echo "changes-log:"
        echo "$CHANGELOG_RECORD"

        echo "scopes:"
        echo "$SCOPES" | jq .
```

You can copy it from the [cd.yml](.github/workflows/cd.yml)

### Custom Commit Types

You can define the commits types and its release in a yml file as next:

```yml
commits:
- type: break
  release: major
- type: major
  release: major
- type: feat
  release: minor
- type: fix
  release: patch
- type: refactor
  release: none
- type: chore
  release: none
- type: test
  release: none
- type: docs
  release: none
- type: ci
  release: none
```

> Please note the `changeTypes` at the root level.
> As a proposal, name the file `semver.yml` and place it in the root of your repo.

Then provide it in the `configuration` input when calling the GH action:

```yml
name: üöÄ continuous-delivery

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  semver:
    name: üöÄ release new version
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4.1.1
    - name: release new version
      uses: cangulo-actions/semver@main
      id: semver
      with:
        configuration: semver.yml
        create-gh-release: true
        print-summary: true
```

### Monorepos or multilayer solutions

Let's say you have a solution with 2 layers: terraform infrastructure and source code apps in JS or C#. You can version both of them separately by defining scopes in the commits. Here are some examples:

| commit msg                                                         | change added           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `fix(tfm): created cloudfront resources and S3 bucket`             | `*.tf` file added      |
| `break(tfm): changed API definition. reporting endpoints deleted.` | `*.tf` file modified   |
| `feat(src): Added new payments dialog to simplify`                 | `*.js,*.html` modified |
| `fix(src): fixed animation when a new user is created`             | `*.css` modified       |
